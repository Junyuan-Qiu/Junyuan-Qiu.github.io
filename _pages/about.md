My research interests lie in **optimization**, with a particular focus on **discrete optimization**. One specific area of interest is decision making under uncertainty, where I aim to provide optimal solutions using stochastic optimization. Additionally, I am motivated to explore the application of machine learning to tackle combinatorial problems.
